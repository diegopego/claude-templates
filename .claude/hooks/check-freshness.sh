# PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash). Blocks `git commit` when the staged set is
# inconsistent with the repo's freshness rules:
#   1. A charter source (templates/charters/sources/) is staged without the
#      composed charters — run the assemble-charters skill.
#   2. templates/ or ideas/ change without CHANGELOG.md staged.
#   3. An adopter-facing deliverable changes without the landing source
#      (root README.md) staged.
#   4. README.md changes without the rendered landing (docs/index.html)
#      staged — regenerate it from README.md.
# Exit 2 blocks the tool call and feeds stderr back to the agent.
